## Self-Evaluation // Colin A. // Enigma

#### Functionality - 3
- The functionality in the program is all there, and I refactored them so that nearly each method is responsible for a
 specific function. No lines over 80+ characters, and no methods over 10+ lines long. I kept readability in mind while 
 building, and combed back through the program to ensure the readability was there. 
- Command-line functionality implemented and working!
- I wanted to be sure I had a solid 3 so I could shoot for the 4 and complete the cracking, however I had to scrap that. Indentation, spacing, etc, are all there in my eyes. I speak from repetitious review!

#### Object Oriented Programming - 3.5
- Uses both inheritance and module in a manner that makes sense for the application.
- I beleive I used the best enumerable for each peice of functionality, I made sure to research!
- I feel confident in my understanding of OOP in the previous week, and I can tell because I use pry a whole lot less
 troubleshooting object interaction. My tests are passing on the 2nd-3rd attempt instead of 7th-8th!

#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3.5
- While this may be a bold assesment, I do so with confidence. Ruby convention and mechanics seem to be second-nature 
 at this point.
- I don't give myself a 4 because of some redundant syntax. Understanding 1-line if statements and things of that nature
 tend to slow me down, need more practice and exposure on that.

#### Test Driven Development - 3.5?
- I give my TDD this score because it was my number one focus point, and I ensured that I wrote every test before creating
 the actual functionality.  I did my best creating assertions for robust-ness, and I'm confident that I thoroughly tested.
- I don't give TDD a full 4 because during refactoring of my encrypt method, some of my dream-driving on 1-2 methods was
 completed before adding a new test for the refactored functionality. Just not perfect, so therefore, 3.5 

#### Version Control - 3
- Great commit history, great commenting. However only one pull request, as all the work was done on one seperate dev_branch.
- As I began to embark on cracking functionality, I realized that my organization for the next step was foggy, and in doing so 
 I did not create a new branch. While I knew it was experimental and did not commit at the time, in hindsight it would have   caused alot of problems for me. As much as I wanted that 4 with my constant commits, I failed to take advantage of new  
 branches.
